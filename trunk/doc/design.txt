This is a very informal design document for Slashd-OS.

I am basically writing this just to gather my thoughts on everything and such...


Ok, starting at boot.
The bootsector will be 1 stage, but will use the first 4 sectors of the floppy. 
The current plan is to use a slightly modified version of StoopidFS. Of course, I never actually made a full design doc of it either, but never the less...

What the bootsector should do.
Load rest of bootsector.
setup any hardware needed(currently, none)
load disk driver(only from disk, into 0x2000, put size in 0x1000:0 [2 bytes])
load FS driver(only from disk, into 0x3000, put size in 0x1000:2 [2 bytes])
load kernel(into 0x9000, put size in 0x1000:4)
far jmp into kernel.
end bootsector.

Proposed Memory Maps: (all in hex)
memory map #1:
0:0-0:755 -used by BIOS
0:755-1000:0 -reserved by kernel.(undecided stuff...)
1000:0-2000:0 -used by bootsector; after that, swap memory. Memory that is swapped into and out of disk as requested by programs, or can be general free memory area. This memory is safe to use after telling kernel how much of this memory will be used. (defaults to 0 for speed purposes)
2000:0-3000:8000 -used by current executing program.
3000:8000-8000:8000 -stores packed loaded programs.
8000:8000-9000:0 -driver stuff.
9000:0-A000:0 -All for kernel code and internal kernel data.
A000:0-C000:0 -device RAM (should not be accessed from programs or even kernel, only from drivers)
D000:0-F000:FFFF -ROM

memory map #2:
0:0-0:755 -used by BIOS
0:755-1000:0 -driver tables and such.
1000:0-2000:0 -used by bootsector, after that is for programs loading.
2000:0-3000:0 -used for >64kb programs 
3000:0-4000:0 -used for >128kb programs -also used for driver swap-in
2000-4000 is swappable memory. 
5000:0-8000:0 -packed background programs. (these are copied out of this area, and into 2000:0 unpacked whenever they get a share of CPU time)
8000:0-9000:0 -driver constant "keep alive"


Memory Map #3:
(using packed applications aligned 16 bytes)
0:0-0:755 -used by BIOS
0:755-2000:0 -reserved for driver tables, application tables, shared memory, and temporary memory.
2000:0-4000:0 -swap memory
5000:0-9000:0 -packed applications and drivers.
9000:0-A000:0 -kernel code and data
A000:0-F000:FFFF -used by devices and BIOS (only accessed by drivers!)

Expanded Memory map for #3:
segment 0
0-755 used by BIOS
755-FFF undecided/unused
1000-1FFFF used for memory page management map.
2000-9000 Used for process handles and structures.
A000-FFFF Used for device nodes.
Segment 1000
0-4000 File handles pointers(can handle up to 1024)



Applica


file handle:
32bit directory number(optional, and only used at filesystem driver level)(this is set to 0 if this file handle is invalid, but not yet free'd)
2 byte device node file handle(note 0 is reserved and if this is zero, then it is a device node)
8 bytes for location information(optional, only used at filesystem driver)



location information:
for an example floppy disk device, it may use:
2 byte ABS sector number
2 byte next ABS sector number(optimization only)
1 byte 




StoopidFS(v2):
StoopidFS is designed to be a very easy to implement FS.
It is, by design, a slow FS, but for hobby OS, it works..
The way files(and directories) are arranged in the filesystem is sequentially. No on-disk table is made.
This means that to find a file at the end of the disk, all files must first be scanned at the first of the disk. 
Names are limited to 255 bytes(254 with null termination).

(0xE9 for rel16 jmp)
21
files are stored in a sector like so:
type(0x0F for file)[1]
sectors used[4]
file size[4]
attributes[2]
name size[1]
directory entry [4]
name(0 terminated) [name size]
data [data size until sector filled]
next sector:
data..



directories are stored in a table starting at a specified sector
note that directory entry 0 is reserved for /
first sector of directories:
type(0x1D for first directory sector) [1]
number of directories [4]
next directory sector [4]
directory entries...

after 1st sector of directories:
type(0xCD)[1]
next directory sector[4]
directory entries...


directory entry format:
directory name size [1]
sub directory[4]
number of files[4]
directory name [name size]



for the bootsector the following is used:
type/jmp(0xE9 for bootsector) [1]
ignored bytes(put jmp address here)[2]
device size[4]
directory start sector[2]
file start sector[2]



Packed Applications:
Rather than each application to run, it be copied to 64kb page, applications in order to be marked
at 'org 0' it must just aligned on a 16 byte border.

Memory will be allocated in 256 byte pages.
For optimization, there is the fight between memory, and speed.
Memory pages have three states. Used, Free, and Reserved.
Used is allocated by program or kernel and is assumed to be used.
Free is unallocated, and unusable(until allocated) for applications and kernel.
Reserved is allocated to a program or kernel, but is not assumed to be used, so that if memory runs out, these pages can be marked as free and be used.
Reserved pages are actually only an optimization mechanism...





Device Drivers:







Applications and Drivers:
Both driver and application files are flat binary files with org '0'.

Appications:
At startup, the registers are set this way:
AX: File handle of current executing file
BX: Process ID
CX: 0
DX: Attributes
SI: Points to argument string
DI: Last safely writable byte in address space(or total size of usable address space)
BP: 0
SP: Points to top of a stack of 512 bytes
CS: Code segment
DS: Code segment
ES: Points to argument string
SS: Points to stack of 512 bytes.



Drivers:

AX: File handle of current executing file(the driver executable)
BX: Process ID
CX: Current size of address space
DX: Value telling what is being requested to be done to node(0 for first loading of driver, 0xFFFF for last shutdown of driver)
SI: String of device node name(without /dev/)
DI:  
BP:
SP:
CS:
DS:
ES:
SS:
